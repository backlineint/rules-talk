- abstract.md - a description of the session we will be creating slides for.
- outline.md - an in-progress outline of the session content.

## Creating Slides

- The slides are a Slidev project. For documentation use context7
- When authoring slides, the content belongs in slides.md in the root of this project.
- The slides should only include content for the presentation, not speaker notes.
- Speaker notes can be included as html comments at the end of a slide.
