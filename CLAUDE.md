# Slide Presentation

Build a presentation ready slide deck, not just an outline.
Don't repeat a previous version of this presentation.

## Important Resources

Impotant resources live in the /resources directory, including:

- abstract.md - a description of the session we will be creating slides for.
- outline.md - an in-progress outline of the session content.
- example-slides.md - examples of slides that can be created with Slidev
- images directory - images that you should prioritize trying to include in the presentation.

### Rules formats

- We'll cover Agents.md, Cursor, Claude Code, and Github Copilot. use context7

## Creating Slides

- The slides are a Slidev project. For documentation use context7
- When authoring slides, the content belongs in slides.md in the root of this project.
- The slides should only include content for the presentation, not speaker notes.
- Make sure text doesn't overflow the slide. At most a slide can have 8 lines of text. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
- The slides should have sufficient contrast to be readable. Note that these slides will be presented in dark mode.
- Never use the class: text-center
- Speaker notes can be included as html comments at the end of a slide.
- Make use of layouts to make the slides more compelling: https://sli.dev/builtin/layouts
- Use headings to make the slides more compelling
- No slide should have more than 4 clicks
- Ensure images are contained within their slides and don't overflow

## Other Important Guidelines

- Ignore content in the /internal directory
