# Images for Slides

- junior_dev.jpg - image of me around the time that I was a junior developer.
- brian-perry.jpg - a good photo of me for the bio slide
- actual-ai.png - an image for the Actual AI Company Slides. It should be used on it's own slide
- context_in_repository.png - an example of how I saved additional context in git history.

The misc directory contains a variety of additional images that could be used to add some variety to the presentation.
