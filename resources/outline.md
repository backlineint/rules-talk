- A slide about me, Brian Perry. I'm a founding engineer at Actual AI. I live in the Chicago suburbs, and I love Nintendo.
- A slide about Cursor, who co-authored this talk.

```
## Cursor: Co-Author of This Talk

- `.cursor/rules` keeps Cursor aligned with the story arc
- Today’s deck is proof that rules + agents co-create real work
