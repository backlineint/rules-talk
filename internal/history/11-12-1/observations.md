# The Problem

Many developers struggle to see benefits from AI coding agents... **or abandon them altogether**

<!--
Here's the core problem we're addressing today. Despite the incredible advances in AI coding agents, many developers still struggle to see the benefits they expect, or they abandon these tools altogether after initial disappointment.

# Writing Effective Rules

<v-clicks>

## Be Specific

❌ "Write good code"  
✅ "Use semantic HTML5 elements and ARIA labels for accessibility"

## Provide Context

❌ "Use TypeScript"  
✅ "Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled. Prefer interfaces for object types."

## Include Examples

❌ "Follow naming conventions"  
✅ "Use PascalCase for components (UserProfile.tsx) and camelCase for utilities (formatDate.ts)"

## Make Rules Actionable

❌ "Consider performance"  
✅ "Lazy load components that are below the fold using React.lazy()"

<!--
Here are the key principles for writing effective rules:

Be specific - instead of "write good code", say "use semantic HTML5 elements and ARIA labels for accessibility"

Provide context - don't just say "use TypeScript", explain "use TypeScript with strict mode enabled and prefer interfaces for object types"

Include examples - show exactly what you mean with concrete file names and patterns

Make rules actionable - instead of "consider performance", give specific guidance like "lazy load components below the fold using React.lazy"
