# TODOS

- Configure an MCP for Slidev docs. Also maybe other tools like cursor and claude code.
- Implement a strategy for including images and related hints.
- Create tests or evals to validate a slide authoring run.
- Create some kind of plan to account for the time it taks Cursor to write the slides. Probably some variation of generating a plan, clicking build quickly, and then reviewing the plan and the codebase.
